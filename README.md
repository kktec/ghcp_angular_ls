This is a simple Angular/Boostrap html5 app for USGA golf handicap tracking that will use local storage.

It's purpose is for me to learn Angular, some Bootstrap, and some other Jaavascript related technologies/techniques. 

__server.js__ - This file is used to startup a Node instance that serves up the app for development. It uses NPM modules connect and static from senchalabs.

__2014-10-01__ : just started

__2014-10-02__ : basic ui in place, using fake data, no validation yet

__2014-10-04__ : much of the app is working now though it is not calculating the handicap index yet
